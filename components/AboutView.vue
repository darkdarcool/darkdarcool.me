    <p class = "about_text"> like a lot of new and young devs. i got bored of quarantine. really bored. all of my online classes were so easy, i was getting all of them done in about an hour, giving me a lot of free time. my mom made me go to a javascript class on microsoft's makecode arcade. the instrctors were really good, but I learned nothing in the class. about a month later, my mom signed me up for a python class. i really liked this class, and the instructor. i actually absorbed the stuff taught to me, and i kept with python for a long time. fast foward 2 years, here i am. (i dont include python in my list of langs because now, i see what a sucky language it was lol) </p>
